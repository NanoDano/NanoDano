Hello, my name is John Leon and I like writing code and music. I work professionally in the cybersecurity field and have a background in programming going back to the 90s. I have written technical books, spoken at conferences, taught numerous courses, and worked on enterprise-level projects.

I have a programming blog and YouTube channel, [devdungeon.com](https://www.devdungeon.com/).

You can find my music and art projects at [electropunk.net](https://www.electropunk.net/).
