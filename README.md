# NanoDano

Hello, I am an architecture and cybersecurity specialist. I've been hacking on computers since the 20th century. Python is my favorite language.

I am currently working on [my Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/nanodano/), SaaS products like [Uppora.net](https://www.uppora.net) website uptime checker and [Cathy Chatbot](https://cathy.devdungeon.com), 

I would be interested to collaborate on SaaS products, educational products, and publishing. I also enjoy creating and playing music of all types and would be interested in musical collaborations.

If you want to read more details about me, visit my blog [www.devdungeon.com/content/about-me](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/about-me).
